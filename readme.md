## Setting up Wase Engine

Requirements:

 - CMake

 - C++17 or higher

You can use the CMake GUI or you can run the following commands in the commandline:
```
mkdir build

```

Now you will be able to build the Wase Engine. When you build the Wase Engine there will be an include and lib folder in the build directory. You can use these for your game projects.
